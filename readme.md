# Picture Puzzle

Randomly generates a sliding puzzle for the user to solve.

I wanted to learn Phaser and took the chance to build this challenge with the lastest version of the library, in es6 and adding tests.

### Prerequisites

```node```
```yarn```

### Installing

```yarn install```

### Commands

#### Launch a local development server

```yarn run dev```

#### Generates a build

```yarn run build```

#### Run the tests

```yarn test```
